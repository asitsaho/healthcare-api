"""The drift test.

Arguably the highest-value test in the project: it compares the ORM metadata
against the schema that the migration chain actually produced. It fails loudly
if someone

* adds a model but forgets to register it in ``db/base.py``, or
* changes a model but forgets to generate a migration, or
* hand-edits a migration so it no longer matches the model.

All three otherwise stay invisible until a deploy.
