"""Shared test fixtures.

Design notes, because several of these choices are non-obvious:

* **No ``event_loop`` fixture.** pytest-asyncio 1.0 removed it. Loop scope is
  configured in pyproject.toml instead, and BOTH
  ``asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope`` and ``asyncio_default_test_loop_scope``
  must be ``session`` -- otherwise the session-scoped engine and the
  function-scoped test end up in different loops and asyncpg raises
  "got Future attached to a different loop".

* **Tests run against a real database**, not SQLite. SQLite silently diverges on
  JSONB/ARRAY/UUID, does not enforce foreign keys by default (so integrity
  tests pass vacuously), and its crippled ALTER TABLE would force batch mode --
  meaning the migration path you ship to production would never be executed by
  the suite.

* **Each test runs inside a transaction that is rolled back.** The schema is
  built once per session by running the real migration chain, so migrations are
  exercised on every run.

* If the database is unreachable, database-backed tests **skip** with a clear
  message rather than erroring, so ``uv run poe test`` works on a fresh clone
  with nothing running.
