"""Alembic environment, wired for an async engine.

Three things here are load-bearing and easy to get wrong; each is explained at
the point where it matters:

1. The URL is injected into a plain dict, never via ``set_main_option``.
2. The password is rendered with ``hide_password=False``.
3. ``run_migrations_online`` honors a caller-supplied connection, which is what
   lets the test suite run the real migration chain.
