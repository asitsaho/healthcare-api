"""Metadata aggregator -- the single module Alembic imports.

Importing a model module is what registers its table on ``Base.metadata``. If a
model is never imported, ``alembic revision --autogenerate`` cheerfully reports
"no changes detected" and you lose an afternoon to it.

So: **every time you add a model, add a line here.** Automatic discovery via
``pkgutil.walk_packages`` is deliberately avoided -- it silently no-ops when a
package lacks ``__init__.py``, turning a loud failure into a quiet one.

``tests/test_migrations.py`` compares this metadata against the real migrated
schema, so forgetting a line here fails the test suite rather than shipping.
